Models
======

The framework offers two backend frameworks by default: **Doctrine** and **Atlas**. **Doctrine** is very
useful when dealing with Domain Logic, and **Atlas** is very useful when dealing with Persistence Logic.

To learn how to configure these backend services in the LightMVC Framework, please see the :ref:`configuration model` section.

For more information on **Doctrine**, please see the `Doctrine website <https://www.doctrine-project.org/>`_.

For more information on **Atlas**, please see the `Atlas website <http://atlasphp.io/>`_.

Code examples of how to use these backend frameworks are given in the :ref:`skeleton` application section of this documentation.
